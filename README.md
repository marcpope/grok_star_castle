# Star Castle Inspired Clone created by Grok 3 Beta

![](starcastle.jpg?raw=true)

This is a game I built using prompts from Grok 3 Beta to test it's coding capabilities. It took just over 2 hours to build the entire game. It's built entirely in javascript.

The game features 3 lives, levels that get harder, scoring.

Use the Arrow keys to move the ship, spacebar to shoot

Break the outer rings to eventually kill the inner space ship but watch out! It will shoot at you too.
